# Neighborhood-Map-React
Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


## About Project

This project displays a map with a few markers with restaurants I like. By clicking on a marker or filtering list on a left side, you can see the name of the restaurant and actual weather in a particular place( in England knowing actual weather is good knowledge:)). 

I have used Google Maps API and Online World Weather API by Apixu, API keys might be not up to date, so if you clone repository and get an authorisation error one or both API keys need to be replaced.

## Requirements

* Node with Npm
* Yarn (with serve if you want to check service worker is working)

## How to get application- [live preview](https://haicia.github.io/neighborhood-map/) or

1. clone the repository
2. install dependencies 
    `npm install`
3. open local server
  `yarn start`
4. (optional) to try included with application boilerplate service worker
  - `yarn build`  
  - `serve -s build`.
